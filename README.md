# LedgerLogic
In this project, I am utilizing Java fundamentals to create a CLI application for personal use in tracking financial transactions. 

Step 1: Setup

-Create a new folder for Capstones within the Pluralsight folder in Finder.
-Initialize a new Git repository in this folder.
-Create a new public GitHub repository for your project with an appropriate name (LedgerLogic).
-Link your local repository to the GitHub repository.

Step 2: Create the Home Screen

-Implement a main menu loop that displays options for the user.
-Prompt the user to choose options (D for Deposit, P for Payment, L for Ledger, R for Reports, X for Exit).

-Implement functionality for each option:
    D: Add Deposit
    P: Make Payment
    L: Display Ledger
    R: Show Reports
    X: Exit Application
    
Step 3: Add Deposit Functionality
-Implement the functionality to add a deposit:
    Prompt the user for deposit information (date, time, description, vendor, amount).
    Save the deposit information to the transactions.csv file.

Step 4: Make Payment Functionality
-Implement the functionality to make a payment (debit):
    Prompt the user for payment information (date, time, description, vendor, amount).
    Save the payment information to the transactions.csv file.
    
Step 5: Ledger Display
-Implement the ledger display functionality:
    Display all ledger entries, showing the newest entries first.
    Allow options to filter entries by Deposits or Payments.
    
Step 6: Reports
-Implement the reports functionality:
    Create a Reports screen with options to run predefined reports.
    -Implement the following predefined reports:
        Month To Date
        Previous Month
        Year To Date
        Previous Year
        Search by Vendor
    -Implement custom search functionality to search for entries by vendor name.
    
Step 7: Back Navigation
-Implement navigation back to the Home screen from the Ledger and Reports screens.

Step 8: Project Documentation
-Update the README file in your GitHub repository to describe your project.
-Include images/screenshots of your application screens in the README.
-Describe one interesting piece of code from your project in the README.

Step 9: Testing and Refinement
-Test your application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
-Refine and improve your code as necessary.
-Commit changes to your Git repository with meaningful commit messages.

Step 10: Final Review and Submission
-Review your project to ensure it meets all requirements.
-Double-check your Git commit history for completeness.
-Make any final adjustments if needed.
